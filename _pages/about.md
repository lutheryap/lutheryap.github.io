## Welcome

Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Princeton University. My research interest is econometrics. I will be going to the Department of Economics at the National University of Singapore (NUS), first as a Presidential Fellow from July 2025 and then as an Assistant Professor from July 2027.
