## Welcome

Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Princeton University and I'll be on the academic job market in 2024-25. My research interests are econometrics and applied microeconomics. 

## Job Market Paper
Inference with Many Weak Instruments and Heterogeneity [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193) [Implementation Code](https://github.com/lutheryap/mwivhet)
